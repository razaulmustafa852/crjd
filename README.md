# GoDash experiments with different network context 
we present a series of experiments using the Mininet network emulator to instantiate a simple topology
where we vary the number of simultaneous DASH clients and the network parameters of the  bottleneck link to generate different scenarios and analyse the observed QoE. 


### Prerequisites

* Mininet Wifi  - [Download](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi)
* Caddy server  - [Download](https://caddyserver.com/)
* Godash player - [Download](http://cs1dev.ucc.ie/misl/goDASH/)


## Running the tests

After installation of each component, open terminal and run the topology by typing 
```
sudo python3 test.py
```
The topology request 4 paramters from user to create network scenerio. 
* How many Hosts
* Bandwidth
* Delay
* Packetloss

The above value can be declared in in test3.py. In test3.py different combination of network were declared as an array. We have experimented with 5,10 & 15 hosts with 5,10, and 15 Mbps.
## Data
Each experiment will create a folder like structure for each experiment. Both for PCAPS & Logfile generated by goDash Player. A sample of log file generated by GoDash player is uploaded.
